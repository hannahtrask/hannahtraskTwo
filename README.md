# Hey, I'm Hannah!

#### As a Software Engineer, I build applications to mirror the human connection: to be authentic, adventurous, and engaging. I engage the user by building code that pushes them to dive deeper into the realm of living their best life.

## About me
I'm a web developer, content creator, and outdoor enthusiast. I recently wrapped up a 480-hour software engineering immersive course through General Assembly. I'm passionate about a lot of things on top of web development: local activism, skiing, spending time with my friends, and whitewater boating.
