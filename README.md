# Hey, I'm Hannah!

#### As a Software Engineer, I build applications to mirror the human connection: to be authentic, adventurous, and engaging. I engage the user by building code that pushes them to dive deeper into the realm of living their best life.

## About me
I'm a web developer, content creator, and outdoor enthusiast. I recently wrapped up a 480-hour software engineering immersive course through General Assembly. I'm passionate about a lot of things on top of web development: local activism, skiing, spending time with my friends, and whitewater boating.

## Current Projects

I recently was working on honing my Next js skills by working on several projectsâ€” the first being a simple movie database app. See the code and repo [here](https://github.com/hannahtrask/MovieApp).

In addition to that, I am working with a team to build a CRM platform for an advertising agency, using mostly Amazon Web Services.

### Woohoo a game!! Two truths and a lie...

1. I lived for two months in Alaska, working as a housekeeper, bartender, and on site blanket knitter and menu designer for a heli-ski operation.
2. For three months, I was a multi-day whitewater raft guide in Oregon and Idaho on the Wild and Scenic Rogue River and the Lower Fork of the Salmon River.
